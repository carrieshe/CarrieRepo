## Step-by-Step Downgrade Procedure

### 1. Backup Before Downgrade

Take the following backups to prevent data loss or unexpected issues:

- **Encryption Keys:**  
  Back up the encryption keys of your current PBIRS. Refer to: [Back up and restore SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) encryption keys - SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/reporting-services/install-windows/ssrs-encryption-keys-back-up-and-restore-encryption-keys?view=sql-server-ver16)

- **Databases:**  
  Backup the `ReportServer` and `ReportServerTempDB` databases.

- **Configuration Files:**  
  | File Name                                      | Default Location                                                                                   |
  |------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | Rssvrpolicy.config                             | C:\Program Files\Microsoft Power BI Report Server\PBIRS\ReportServer                               |
